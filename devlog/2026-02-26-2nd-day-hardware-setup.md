FLASHING PROCESS
-Finally flashed postmarketOS
-Faced multiple challenges, phone going it EDL mode and had crashboot mode on first startup
-Maybe due to my skillset but online guide and full browser interface needed for "normies"

IMMEDIATE OBSERVATIONS
- Front camera too zoomed in and in black & white
- Back camera fuzzy and green. Shutter speed seems good. Gallery screen gestures could be better.
- Screen goes completely black when starting a call - no control except volume
- Friend reported feedback when talking on the phone - mic not muting when other person talking?
- Some settings don't allow swipe to go back - why?
- No haptic feedback when typing - needs sorting
- Installing Whatsapp via waydroid is a pain - had to sideload the APK and having major difficulties getting waydroid to connect to the internet
