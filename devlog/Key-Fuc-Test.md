Core functions — test and rate each 1-5:
-Incoming/Outgoing call (does it work at all?)
Tested 28/2/26- incoming calls working and signal good in UK. I could hear other person clearly but they reported feedback from their end. Mic not muting when they are talking? Also had a black screen as soon as answered - only button controls functional at that time (~15-20 seconds)
Tested 28/2/26 outgoing calls to voicemail (no credit available) call connected but no further tests made. Will top up and report back.
-Call audio both directions
